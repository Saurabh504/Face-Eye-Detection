# There is a variety of computer applications that identify the eye in digital images, 
# like- security systems, criminal identification, healthcare, and so on.
# The eye-detection algorithms focus on the detection of the frontal human eye. 
# The Python OpenCV library functions are mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. 
# It is mainly used to do all the operations for image processing as well as detect objects.
# OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for faces, eyes, smiles, etc.
